I didn't want to be contacted by anyone, and my greatest desire was to just film mother nature as it was meant to be seen. On my first day, I befriended a family of foxes by sharing some water and some of the rabbit I had hunted down earlier. I was quickly entranced by their daily rituals and filmed their every action. Eventually, footage that I had originally wanted to encompass all of mother nature became dominated by this single family.</p><p><br></p><p>I hope you'll support this project - I want to share the stunning visuals of the foxes, from their play-fighting to their moments of quiet contemplation.</p>", category: "Film", goal: 7500, pledged_amount: 0, public: true, creator_id: User.fourth.id},
